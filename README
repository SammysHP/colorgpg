NAME
    colorgpg - colorized output for 'gpg'

SYNOPSIS
    colorgpg --list-sigs [names]
    colorgpg --list-keys [names]
    colorgpg ---
    colorgpg

DESCRIPTION
    This program is a wrapper for the 'gpg' command to make the output
    colorized.
    
    Currently only the listing of keys is supported. You can invoke the program
    with --list-keys or --list-sigs and optional names specifying the keys. See
    'man gpg' for help.
    
    The option --- is used to read from stdin (- will be forwarded to 'gpg' for
    compatibility reasons). This way you can colorize e.g. previously stored
    output of 'gpg'.
        gpg --list-sigs > gpg.out; colorgpg --- < gpg.out

    All other commands will be forwarded to 'gpg' without wrapping. This means
    that you can use 'colorgpg' instead of 'gpg' for all actions and that colors
    will be added if possible.
